      "A wonderful little production  The filming technique is very unassuming very oldtimeBBC fashion and gives a comforting and sometimes discomforting sense of realism to the entire piece  The actors are extremely well chosen Michael Sheen not only has got all the polari but he has all the voices down pat too You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams diary entries not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece  A masterful production about one of the great masters of comedy and his life  The realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears  It plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets particularly of their flat with Halliwells murals decorating every surface are terribly well done \n",
      "I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a lighthearted comedy  The plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer  While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point  Risk Addiction I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love This was the most Id laughed at one of Woodys comedies in years dare I say a decade  While Ive never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into a average but spirited young woman This may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than Devil Wears Prada and more interesting than Superman a great comedy to go see with friends \n",
      "Basically theres a family where a little boy Jake thinks theres a zombie in his closet  his parents are fighting all the time This movie is slower than a soap opera    and suddenly Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie OK first of all when youre going to make a film you must Decide if its a thriller or a drama As a drama the movie is watchable  Parents are divorcing  arguing like in real life  And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots  out of  just for the well playing parents  descent dialogs  As for the shots with Jake just ignore them \n",
      "Petter Matteis Love in the Time of Money is a visually stunning film to watch  Mr  Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations  This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter  This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzlers play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect  Each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact  Stylishly the film has a sophisticated luxurious look  We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits  A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter The acting is good under Mr  Matteis direction  Steve Buscemi Rosario Dawson Carol Kane Michael Imperioli Adrian Grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alive We wish Mr  Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work \n"

Poderia se imaginar que a Word2Vec ia causar perda de informação e portanto uma performance pior mas na verdade depende. No Random Forest isso foi sim verdade mas no XGBoost a vetorização W2V teve a melhor performance. Para o BoW e o TF-IDF, o BoW supera o outro nos dois casos, mesmo truncando as entradas para diminuir a esparsidade dos vetores."
